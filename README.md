# Sudoku_Solvers

This repository presents a project focused on implementing and testing two distinct methods for solving Sudoku puzzles: **Depth-First Search (DFS) brute force with backtracking** (both with and without heuristic optimizations) and **Knuth's Algorithm X**. The project also includes a comparative analysis of each method's **completeness, optimality, and time complexity**. The ultimate goal is to identify the most efficient method for solving Sudoku puzzles across various difficulty levels.

## Repository Content

1. **`Several_Sudoku_Solvers.pdf`**  
   A detailed report is provided, including the implementation of each method and their results in solving various Sudoku puzzles. The report also includes a comparative analysis between the methods, along with additional insights.

2. **`DFS with backtracking.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and tests of the DFS BF with backtracing (**without** heuristic optimizations).
   
3. **`CleverDFS.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and tests of the DFS BF with backtracing (**with** heuristic optimizations).

4. **`AlgorithmX.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and tests of the Knuth's Algorithm X.
   
6. **`Comparisons.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing graphical comparisons of solving time and time complexity between the implemented Sudoku solvers.

## Suggested Workflow

For a better understanding, it is recommended to first read the **report** to get an overview of the project and then proceed to explore and run the **code**.
