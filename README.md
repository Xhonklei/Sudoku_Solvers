# Sudoku_Solvers

This repository presents a project focused on implementing and testing two distinct methods for solving Sudoku puzzles: **Depth-First Search (DFS) brute force with backtracking** (both with and without heuristic optimizations) and **Knuth's Algorithm X**. The project also includes a comparative analysis of each method's **completeness, optimality, and time complexity**. The ultimate goal is to identify the most efficient method for solving Sudoku puzzles across various difficulty levels.

## Repository Content

1. **`Image_feature_extraction_and_matching.pdf`**  
   A detailed report is provided, encompassing an analysis of each method, their respective implementations, and the resulting matches. The report also includes a comparative analysis between the methods, along with additional insights.

2. **`harris2.py`**  
   A Python script implementing the Harris Corner Detector.

3. **`TestHarrisCorners.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook for testing corner extraction using the Harris Corner Detector.
   
4. **`TestHarrisMatches.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook for testing the matching of similar features (Harris corners) between two images.

5. **`SIFT_matcher.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the SIFT Matcher and tests for matching similar features between two images.

## Suggested Workflow

For a better understanding, it is recommended to first read the **report** to get an overview of the project and then proceed to explore and run the **code**.
